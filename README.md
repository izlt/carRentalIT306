## Project’s purpose and business requirements
This project is for users to track information of employees, vehicles, and the employees’ customers. The program is required to have at least one administrative employee. The user, as either a regular or administrative employee, should select a type of vehicle classes for an individual vehicle. All input should be validated and create an error message if any invalid input is entered. All data are stored in text files and when an administrative employee tries to read any output, the program should be able to use the text file to retrieve the data.
